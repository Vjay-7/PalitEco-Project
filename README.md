PalitEco is an e-commerce web application designed for eco-friendly products. The name 'PalitEco' is a play on the Filipino phrase 'palitiko,' meaning 'buy me,' reflecting the app's mission to reduce pollution and protect the environment. The website features a simple yet effective front-end design. This project earned the 1st runner-up award at the Dev-Fest organized by GDSC-USTP.
